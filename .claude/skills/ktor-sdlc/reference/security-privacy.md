# Security & privacy reference

Organised around the OWASP API Security Top 10, with the OWASP ASVS level chosen in Phase 1:
- **L1** is the minimum for every service.
- **L2** applies to any service that handles personal, financial, health or other sensitive data, which means most backends behind a mobile app.
- **L3** applies to critical systems (e.g. payments, medical devices) and needs an ADR with a security specialist.

Verify the level in Phase 5. The code for the controls is in [code-patterns.md](code-patterns.md).

## The ground rule for secrets
- **Secrets live in a secret manager** (cloud secret manager, Vault, Kubernetes secrets backed by one) and reach the process as environment variables or mounted files at runtime.
- **Never in Git, images, logs, tickets or error messages.** `application.yaml` names the variable with no default value; config classes holding secrets override `toString()`.
- **Rotate them.** Database passwords, webhook secrets and API keys have an owner and a rotation date; the service reads them at start, so rotation is a redeploy.
- **Least privilege.** The service's database user owns no schema in production: it can read and write its tables, not drop them. The migration job uses a separate user with DDL rights.

## OWASP API Security Top 10
| Risk | Control in a Ktor service | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| API1 Broken object-level authorisation | Every service method takes the `Caller` and checks ownership or membership of the object; another user's object is a 404 | The 404 case in each endpoint's route tests; authorisation matrix tests in Phase 5 |
| API2 Broken authentication | Tokens only from the identity provider; signature, issuer, audience and expiry verified against the JWKS; short-lived access tokens; no API keys for users | Route tests with wrong audience, wrong issuer and expired tokens |
| API3 Broken object-property-level authorisation | Separate request and response DTOs per endpoint; no domain model or row serialized; no `receive<Map<…>>` | Review; contract check |
| API4 Unrestricted resource consumption | RequestBodyLimit; maximum page size; RateLimit per caller; timeouts on queries and outbound calls; limits on uploads and batch sizes | Tests at the limits; load tests |
| API5 Broken function-level authorisation | Roles checked in the service for privileged operations; admin endpoints in a separate route group with their own authentication | Route tests with a non-admin token |
| API6 Unrestricted access to sensitive business flows | Per-account and per-device limits on sign-up, password reset, OTP, checkout; bot detection or app attestation (Play Integrity, App Attest) where abuse is likely | Abuse-case tests; monitoring |
| API7 Server-side request forgery | No fetching of client-supplied URLs; where it's a feature, an allow-list of hosts and schemes, no redirects, internal ranges and cloud metadata endpoints blocked | Tests with internal addresses |
| API8 Security misconfiguration | Development mode off; no stack traces in responses; security headers; CORS allow-list or no CORS; TLS only; default credentials removed | DAST (e.g. ZAP) in Phase 5; config review |
| API9 Improper inventory management | Every endpoint in the OpenAPI contract with an owner; old versions have a sunset date; no undocumented debug routes | Contract check; route listing vs contract |
| API10 Unsafe consumption of APIs | Responses from third parties validated and size-limited; timeouts; their errors mapped, not passed through | Adapter tests with `MockEngine` |

## Authentication and sessions
- **Bearer tokens (JWT) from an OpenID Connect provider** are the default for mobile and service clients ([code](code-patterns.md#authentication)).
  - Verify the signature with keys from the provider's JWKS, cached and rate-limited; accept only the expected algorithms (asymmetric, e.g. RS256 or ES256).
  - Verify `iss`, `aud` and `exp`, with a small clock-skew leeway (e.g. 30 s).
  - The subject (`sub`) is the user ID; roles and scopes come from agreed claims.
- **Service-to-service calls** use their own credentials (client-credentials tokens, or mTLS inside the mesh), never a user's token passed along without a check.
- **Browser clients:** prefer a backend-for-frontend with cookie sessions (`Sessions` plugin) over tokens in browser storage. Cookies are `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`; state-changing requests need CSRF protection.
- **Passwords** (only if the service must store them, which an identity provider avoids): Argon2id with OWASP's parameters; never a fast hash. Rate-limit and monitor sign-in.

## Input and output
- **Validate everything that crosses the boundary:** types and shapes by deserialization into DTOs, values by RequestValidation (length, format, range, allow-lists), rules by the service.
- **SQL only through Exposed's DSL** or bound parameters. Never build SQL strings from input; sort fields come from an allow-list.
- **JSON limits:** the body size limit covers deeply nested or huge payloads; collection sizes in requests are validated.
- **File uploads** (if any): a size limit, a content check (magic bytes, not the extension), a malware scan, storage in an object store under a generated name, never on the local disk or served from the app's domain.
- **Output encoding.** The API returns JSON only. Anything the server renders (emails, PDFs, HTML) encodes user content for its context.

## Transport and headers
- **TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3) at the edge.** The service usually terminates TLS at a load balancer or ingress; traffic behind it stays in a private network, or uses mTLS where the threat model requires it.
- **Forwarded headers.** Install `XForwardedHeaders` (or `ForwardedHeaders`) only when a proxy you control overwrites them; otherwise any client can spoof its IP address, which also breaks rate limiting.
- **Headers:** `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; `Cache-Control: no-store` on responses with personal data.
- **CORS** only for browser clients, with an allow-list of origins from configuration. Never `anyHost()`, never credentials with a wildcard.

## Data protection
- **Data classification** from Phase 1 decides the controls per field: public, internal, personal, sensitive.
- **Encryption at rest** for every database, volume and backup (managed keys). Field-level encryption or tokenisation for the most sensitive fields (e.g. government IDs), with keys in a KMS (L2+).
- **IDs** are non-sequential (UUID v7), so they can't be enumerated.
- **Backups** are encrypted, copied to another account or region, and restore-tested.

## Logging and audit
- **Never log** tokens, passwords, secrets, full request or response bodies, or personal data. Log IDs, codes and counts.
- **Redact in the logging layer** (e.g. a Logback masking pattern for `Authorization` headers and known fields), not by developer discipline alone.
- **Audit log** for security-relevant events: sign-in failures, permission changes, access to sensitive records, admin actions, data exports. Who, what, when, from where, and the call ID. Kept separate from application logs, tamper-evident, retained per policy.

## Supply chain
- **Dependencies:** versions only from the version catalog; automated update PRs; a dependency vulnerability scan in CI (e.g. OWASP Dependency-Check or the platform's scanner) that fails on high and critical findings.
- **Image:** a minimal base (distroless or a slim JRE), running as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem; scanned in CI (e.g. Trivy); built once and promoted by digest.
- **Provenance:** an SBOM (e.g. CycloneDX) and a signed image for each release.
- **CI secrets** are scoped to the jobs that need them; pull requests from forks get none.

## Privacy
- **Minimise.** Collect only what a requirement needs; the data inventory lists each personal field, its purpose and its retention.
- **Retention.** A scheduled, idempotent job deletes or anonymises data past its retention period.
- **Data-subject rights.** Endpoints or runbooks for access, export and erasure, including backups and downstream copies, within the legal deadline.
- **Residency.** Data stays in the regions the requirements name; check where logs, traces and backups go too.
- **Pseudonymised analytics.** Events carry a pseudonymous ID, never an email or a name.
- **Compliance mapping** (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2): each applicable control maps to a requirement and a test. Reduce scope where possible; e.g. card data goes straight to a payment provider and never touches the service.

## Quick check for reviewers
- A new endpoint outside `authenticate`, or without an object-level check in its service method?
- A domain model, an Exposed row or a `Map` serialized as a response, or received as a request?
- SQL built from strings? A sort or filter field not on an allow-list?
- A secret, token or personal data in code, config defaults, logs or error responses?
- A collection without a maximum page size, or an outbound call without a timeout?
- A client-supplied URL fetched by the server?
- A new dependency without a reason, or with known vulnerabilities?
- A new personal data field without a data-inventory entry and a retention rule?
